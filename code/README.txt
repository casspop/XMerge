This is XMerge v1.4.0

Changes made in v1.4.0:
1. Finally added the ability to select sources scattered all over the place.
2. Insure the .ini file is read when a new output folder is selected.
3. Upgraded tkhtmlview to v0.1.3 and updated some help text.
4. Tidied up a bit in general.
5. Got rid of the annoying 'Purge output folder?' prompt.
