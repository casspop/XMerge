# Convert and combine multiple flat data files into one without Excel

If you are an Excel guru, you don't need this.  But if you aren't, and you have several .csv, tab-delimited, or .xls or .xlsx files that you need to quickly and simply compile into one, XMerge can help.

Choose your settings, select your source files (must live in same folder), the hit the 'Go' button.

XMerge copies the source files to a temp directory and works on them there.  The originals are not touched.  The temp directory is deleted when XMerge finishes.

XMerge puts the output file you specified into the folder you specified.

It's a pretty easy tool to use.

As with all software, you are responsible to make sure it works properly on your files before using it in any production environment.  XMerge has been tested extensively, but that doesn't mean every possible scenario has been tried.  You might be trying to use it in a way no one else thought of, so test first.
